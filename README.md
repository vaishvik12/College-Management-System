### Project Management System

The Project Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline and manage educational course-related data efficiently. This system is structured around core entities including Course, Faculty, Batch, and Student, each represented by their respective Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs). 

#### Key Components:

1. **Course POJO**: Represents the details of a course, including course ID, name, and description.
2. **Faculty POJO**: Captures information about faculty members such as faculty ID, name, and expertise.
3. **Batch POJO**: Defines batch-specific data, including batch ID, course ID, faculty ID, and schedule.
4. **Student POJO**: Contains student details like student ID, name, and batch ID.

#### Implementation Classes:

For each POJO, there is a corresponding implementation class that provides concrete methods to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and other relevant functionalities. These methods are defined within interfaces, ensuring a modular and extensible design.

#### Service Class:

The Service Class acts as the entry point of the application, containing the `main` method. It integrates all functionalities, demonstrating how the different components interact with each other. Through this class, users can perform operations like adding new courses, enrolling students, assigning faculty to batches, and managing batch schedules.

#### Features:

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns through POJOs, interfaces, and implementation classes.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable for additional features or modifications.
- **CRUD Operations**: Comprehensive methods for managing courses, faculty, batches, and students.
- **User Interaction**: Main method in the Service Class provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the system.

This Project Management System is a robust tool for educational institutions, allowing seamless management of courses, faculty, batches, and students, thus enhancing administrative efficiency.
